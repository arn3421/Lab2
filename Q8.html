 <h1>THE Paragraph 1</h1>

    <p>Simply put, a paragraph is a collection of sentences all related to a central topic, 
idea, or theme. Paragraphs act as structural tools for writers
 to organize their thoughts into an ideal progression, and they
 also help readers process those thoughts effortlessly. Imagine how much 
harder reading and writing would be if everything was just one long block 
of text. 

There’s a lot of flexibility when it comes to writing paragraphs, 
but if there’s one steadfast rule, it’s this: Paragraphs should 
relate to one main topic or point. The paragraph itself often contains
 multiple points spanning several sentences, but they should all
 revolve around one core theme. Just as sentences build upon each
 other to communicate the paragraph’s core theme, paragraphs work
 together to communicate the core theme of the writing as a whole. 


That’s the basic idea, but in practice there’s more to it. 
Let’s look at the four main types of paragraphs to 
learn how and when to use them.
